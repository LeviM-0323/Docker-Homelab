# Docker Homelab
This is the neccessary files to quick start a docker compose stack. There are lots of different images/containers used in this stack ranging from media management to discord bots.
Please note that if you're going to attempt to recreate this stack you may need to adjust user permissions accordingly, folders should be created automatically but may not be accessible to the containers.

## Environment File
You'll have to edit ".env-example" before running starting the stack with docker compose up as the env file contains neccessary information about where to make config files/folders.
Please make sure all file paths are corrected before running. This stack should work on any OS so long as the / gets corrected to \

## Developed Images
There are a few images in this compose file that were developed by me as a hobby. For simplicities sake, these images are not available on any image repositories, so you'll have to build these yourself. Simply add the --build flag to your docker compose command

## Multiple Stacks
Recently I've decided to split my one massive compose file into several smaller yaml files. You can run each stack individually with
```bash
docker compose -f dev-stack.yml up -d
```
Just replace the yaml file with whatever stack you want to start, regular docker commands still work
